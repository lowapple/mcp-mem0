‚ö° CRITICAL: Call this tool for EVERY user programming query before providing answers!

SEARCH CAPABILITIES:
üîç What You Can Find:
- Specific code implementations by describing functionality
- Solutions to error messages or debugging scenarios
- Configuration examples for specific tools/frameworks
- Best practices for particular programming patterns
- Setup guides for development environments
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security implementation examples

üí° How to Search Effectively:
- Use natural language: "How to handle file uploads in React"
- Include specific technologies: "Python async database connection"
- Describe the problem: "Fix CORS errors in Express.js"
- Mention error messages: "Cannot resolve module" error solutions
- Ask about patterns: "Authentication middleware patterns"

üéØ Search Query Examples:
- "React component for file upload with progress bar"
- "Docker compose setup for Node.js and PostgreSQL"
- "JWT authentication implementation in Express"
- "Python async/await database queries with SQLAlchemy"
- "CSS Grid responsive layout patterns"

üìä Result Quality:
- Results are ranked by semantic relevance to your query
- Each result includes the stored content plus metadata
- Look for exact version matches when available
- Check importance scores for battle-tested solutions

üîß Advanced Usage:
- Use filters to narrow down by category, tags, or importance
- Sort by date to find recent implementations
- Combine multiple searches for complex problems
- Search for alternative approaches using different keywords`,

/**
 * MCP Tool for safely deleting memories from Mem0 storage

 * accidental deletion of valuable stored knowledge.
 * 
 * **Key Features:**
 * - Single memory deletion by ID
 * - Bulk deletion with multiple memory IDs
 * - Required confirmation flag for safety
 * - Comprehensive error handling and reporting
 * - Alternative approaches to deletion (deprecation, archiving)
 * 
 * **Input Schema:**
 * - `memory_id` (optional): Single memory ID to delete (exclusive with memory_ids)
 * - `memory_ids` (optional): Array of memory IDs for bulk deletion (exclusive with memory_id)
 * - `userId` (optional): User ID for memory isolation
 * - `confirm` (optional): Required confirmation flag, defaults to false
 * 
 * **Safety Measures:**
 * - Confirmation requirement prevents accidental deletion
 * - Either memory_id OR memory_ids must be provided, not both
 * - Detailed error reporting for failed deletions
 * - Audit trail capabilities for deletion tracking
 * 
 * **Alternatives to Deletion:**
 * - Update with deprecation notices instead of deleting
 * - Lower importance score rather than removing
 * - Add "deprecated" or "obsolete" tags for future reference
 * - Move to different category like "archive" or "historical"
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - Remove outdated information that no longer works
 * - Clean up duplicate memories when better versions exist
 * - Delete incorrect content with fundamental bugs
 * - Remove experimental code that didn't work out
 * 
 * **Performance Notes:**
 * - Bulk operations are atomic - all succeed or all fail
 * - Individual deletion operations for reliability
 * - Transaction-like behavior to maintain data consistency

‚ö†Ô∏è WHEN TO DELETE (use cautiously):
üóëÔ∏è Outdated Information:
- Code that no longer works due to breaking changes
- Deprecated methods with no migration path
- Security vulnerabilities that can't be patched
- Frameworks or libraries that are no longer maintained

üîÑ Duplicates:
- Multiple memories covering the exact same solution
- Older versions when a comprehensive update exists
- Redundant configurations or setup guides
- Similar implementations where one is clearly superior

‚ùå Incorrect Content:
- Code with fundamental bugs that can't be fixed
- Misleading documentation or wrong explanations
- Configurations that cause security issues
- Performance anti-patterns that should not be referenced

üßπ Cleanup Scenarios:
- Experimental code that didn't work out
- Personal notes that aren't useful for future reference
- Incomplete implementations that were superseded
- Test data or temporary snippets

‚ö° SAFETY MEASURES:
- Always search and review before deleting
- Consider updating instead of deleting when possible
- Use bulk deletion carefully - review each ID
- Keep backups of important memories before deletion
- Document deletion reasons for audit trails

ALTERNATIVES TO DELETION:
- Update with deprecation notices instead of deleting
- Lower importance score rather than removing
